Software to check students` work

This is the first version, which is actually is mvp version
Code style here is poor so refactoring is needed. 

Major things for refactoring are:
1. Split huge funtion into many small funtions with unique funtinality
2. Correct some bad code style things such as constant declaration etc
3. Add some utility classes which incapsulate unique funtionality
